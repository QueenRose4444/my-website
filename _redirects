# --- PART 1: Force Trailing Slash on Directories ---
# Redirects paths without a slash to the version with a slash.
# This ensures relative URLs on your pages work as expected.
# Example: /home -> /home/
#
/home                        /home/                                       301

/experiments                 /experiments/                                301
/experiments/BBCode_editor   /experiments/BBCode_editor/                  301
/experiments/keyboard_heatmap /experiments/keyboard_heatmap/                301
/experiments/promt_editor    /experiments/promt_editor/                   301

# --- PART 2: Rewrite Directory URLs to HTML Files ---
# Serves the content of an HTML file when a user visits a directory.
# This is a rewrite (200), so the URL in the browser bar does not change.
# Example: User visits /home/, they see that URL, but get home/home.html content.
#
/home/                       /home/home.html                              200
/meds/                       /meds/meds.html                              200
/experiments/                /experiments/experiments.html                200
/experiments/BBCode_editor/  /experiments/BBCode_editor/bbcode_editor.html 200
/experiments/keyboard_heatmap/ /experiments/keyboard_heatmap/keyboard-heatmap.html 200
/experiments/promt_editor/   /experiments/promt_editor/promt_editor.html   200
/wip/home/                   /wip/home/home.html                          200
/wip/meds/                   /wip/meds/meds.html                          200
/wip/experiments/            /wip/experiments/experiments.html            200


# --- PART 3: Redirect Direct .html Links to Clean URLs ---
# If a user lands on a .html file directly, redirect them to the clean directory URL.
# Example: /home/home.html -> /home/
#
/home/home.html              /home/                                       301
/meds/meds.html              /meds/                                       301
/experiments/experiments.html /experiments/                               301
/experiments/BBCode_editor/bbcode_editor.html /experiments/BBCode_editor/  301
/experiments/keyboard_heatmap/keyboard-heatmap.html /experiments/keyboard_heatmap/ 301
/experiments/promt_editor/promt_editor.html /experiments/promt_editor/     301
/wip/home/home.html          /wip/home/                                   301
/wip/meds/meds.html          /wip/meds/                                   301
