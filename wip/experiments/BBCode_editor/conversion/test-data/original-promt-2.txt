okie yup the parser is working enough for v1 of the application we need to get the rest of the features into a working state (by this i mean where its fully functional and able to perform everything it used to do)
so yeah lets start doing the rest of the part of the site please

by this, im meaning atm there does not seem to be anyway to create the template to a state where it can be used to take the input raw text and make a nice output like we want 
similar to how the old application let the user input raw text and have a custom output, along with settings they could adjust
thats what i mean by v1 of the application where it is fully functional and able to take raw data and output a nice BBCode output for the user to use

so we have the ui layout page but we can input the modules in their or anything so clearly we are still behind what id classify as V1 state of the application 
can you please re-alalyse the project we are doing and the old files and all that, and stuffs to properly understand this all 

so yeah the UI layout tab has no UI editing ability to inser/move the modules, drag drop file, input text, output, colour, text editor (this could be used as the adding url's like in original code theyd have custom names and stuffs), user can make their own modules which edit different things 

this is why i thought wed need a logic page like 
if user clicks add group it needs to understand how to add a group of url's or updates, and how to do things wihtin those modules like add more links/text editing areas, and copy file names (that the user has custom made) and stuffs like that 
if that all makes sense to you?

here is the orriginal promt i gave you 
"wip/experiments/BBCode_editor/conversion/test-data/original-promt.txt"





so to be clear the use page is something we need to develop, 
but we also need to finish developing the template builder section First
like okay so i dont understand why we have a UI modules page and a seperate Layout page? 
why arent they the same page/menu 
beucase in my plan/head, the layout page should influnce how the "Use" page looks
and the UI modules need to be editble so we can adjust things such as adding more "text/url editors", adding url groups, adding update groups, things like that, which we did in the original code (but not calling them url groups or update groups unless thats what the user names them as, if that makes sense)

so can we find out all the things we have not yet completed (or that are not correctly functional) for the editing page
