# My Website files
(entirely developed using AI tools)

I originally made this site to have a way to track medication levels for a medication "mounjaro" which im using for weight loss 

I then added some weight tracking aswell 

I have also added some extra pages to my site since then,
 
-   Keyboard Heatmap: to visualise how someone spams on their keyboard 
-   Promt editor: which allows the user to more easily add files to promts when they communicate to an AI model which does not allow for importing of files (or a file of that type) such as DeepSeek R1 when having search enabled
-   Discord Notifier: it allows the user to be notified when an element of a website changes via a discord bot message
-   BBcode editor: which still needs to be worked on, but will allow the user to make and visualise templates for easy importing and editing of data within the bbcode format such as url's and the such
